<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>What's up! I'm Vanessa. You have reached my portfolio website.</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer but am just starting to learn web dev. It's been pretty fun so far, and I can't wait to learn more!</p>

<p>Outside of my career and school, I love staying active through pretty much every activity imaginable (yoga, dance, running, etc), getting lost on YouTube, and reading LOTS of books!</p>
